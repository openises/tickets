2.3
=====
+ An 'auto poll' feature was added for automatic APRS polling, via CONGIGURATION/Auto_Poll 
	value, with zero, the default value, signifying no auto-poll.  Otherwise, this is the poll
	frequency in minutes. Clicking on the displayed value toggles the auto-poll function.
+ We added the TRACKS module, which displays APRS track data accumulated within the last 10 days.
+ User data was extended to include user call sign, in anticipation of some future use.
+ INSTALL was revised to assign a predetermined GMAPS API key if the host domain is either 
	'localhost' or '127.0.0.1' - common values during testing.
+ A newly added Ticket will now link automatically to the UNITS module, for rapid selection of 
	a unit for response.
+ NOTIFY was corrected to generate notification email automatically on any change or action on 
	selected run ticket.
+ The GMAPS API key was made user-revisable via the CONFIGURATION/GMaps API Key entry.
+ Selected modules were revised for automatic refresh every three minutes in order to keep the
	displays more current.

2.2
=====
+ The routes script was added, accessed via a link on the "this Ticket" header.  This feature displays a route to the 
    selected incident from each response unit. The nearest unit is selected initially.
+ APRS data handling was further revised and significantly strengthened by Randy Hammock. (Thanks, guy!)
+ We performed a rather thorough scrub of undefined variables, no longer assuming that PHP errors would be hidden.
+ Install was revised to include an initial test of the  entered MySQL connection parameters, hopefully avoiding 
    detours to never-never-land.

2.1
=====
+ APRS data handling was revised to avoid storing duplicates, and also to delete returns older than 30 days.
+ An improvement to get_variables() significantly reduced the MySQL hit rate, with good performance improvement.
+ Current tickets display now includes those closed within 24 hours, these displayed with a strikethrough.
+ Install was revised to confirm that the subdirectory structure was valid - detecting bad unzipping.
+ Search was corrected to display the map if a singleton result.
+ PHPCoord and associated UTM displays were corrected. (Thanks, Beau)
+ Several leftover JS alerts were removed from config.php

2.0
=====
+ Too many changes to go into the details here, but the major ones are as follows.
+ The big one is the addition of GMaps, allowing the capture of geographic information 
   associated with each ticket.
+ Table Patient was added, as a variant on table Action.
+ Table Responder was added, to maintain information on Response Units - mobile or fixed.
+ Table Tracks was added, capturing information on the location of mobile Response Units.
+ We added an interface to aprsworld for the capture of APRS data on these.
+ Table Log was added to capture logging information for future use in reporting. Not used
  in this release.
