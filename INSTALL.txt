 Tickets Installation Instructions (March 3, '09)                           

=========================================================================

1.  These instructions assume you already have an installed stack consisting
    of a web server, PHP, and MySQL.  If not, see note 13 below for information
    on free open source packages that include Apache, PHP, MySql, and some 
    useful tools.  For Microsoft shops, MS's IIS may be used instead of Apache,
    but you'll still need the other packages.

2.  Unzip the file into its own directory. (Any valid directory name will do.)    
    * WAMP users will probably use one under wamp/www, (ex: wamp/www/tickets)
    * XAMPP users should use the htdocs directory (ex: xampp/htdocs/tickets)
    * If using another web server, the Tickets folder should be in the
      web root directory, for convenience.

3.  Create an empty database, probably using PHPMyAdmin. (Any valid db name will do.)
    * For WAMP/XAMPP users, PHPMyAdmin is one of the provided tools.
    * Remember the database name and connection parameters, including Host,
	  MySQL User Name, and Password - which you supplied for the MySQL 
	  installation.

4.  To start the install process, point your browser to "install.php" in your 
	new Tickets directory. Example: http://127.0.0.1/tickets/install.php 
    * You'll then need to enter some of the information re the just-created
      database from step 3 above.
    * The GMaps API key is already set for you if your local domain is either       
      'localhost' or ' 127.0.0.1 ' .  Otherwise, using the provided URL, link to
      the Google site for that key.  (The key is free; read their Terms of Use.)
    * Later, when you're ready for remote access - including by yourself -
      you'll need a 'real' GMaps key, not the one inserted by the installer
      for localhost use.  Obtain it at the Google URL provided,
      using your domain name.  Read their Terms of Use.
    * If you encounter a complaint  'ERROR! File 'whatever' is not writable ... "
      it means exactly that.  It's in the incs/ subdirectory, and you shd 
      change the permissions on that file or directory to enable writing,
      and try again.

5.  After a successful install process, log in as administrator using the 
    automatically generated userid and 	password. (This is mandatory for the 
    following steps.)  Now, PLEASE read the HELP/Readme file.

6.  After that, you'll prbly want to set your own map default center/zoom.
    Navigate to 'CONFIGURATION/Edit Settings/Set Default Map' to do that.

7.  Next, you may want to set up your response units, via the 'UNITS',
    'Add a Unit' button.
    * You may want to change the built-in 'status types', depending on your
      operation. See 'CONFIGURATION/Unit status types' to do so.
    * Hams note:  Tickets will poll APRS for position reports if you've defined
      the unit as 'remote' and as 'APRS', provided a call sign, and set a 
      non-zero APRS poll time.  See next step 9. below for how to do so.
      
8.  You'll probably want to set up your own incident types next.  To do so,
    See 'CONFIGURATION/Incident types' to do so.

9.  Hit 'CONFIGURATION/Edit Settings for a collection of settings that you
    may want to revise in order to tailor its operations to your local needs. 
    (Like the APRS poll time value, in minutes.)  Mouseover the captions for 
    hints on setting values.

10.  Please remember that Tickets is in BETA testing. Be kind to us.  ;-)
    * But let us know what needs to be changed/improved/ etc.    
    * Stay tuned for new versions - Tickets is young and growing.

11. Please - no, make that PLEASE! - review the security recommendations     
    reference to the install script and its automatically-created accounts.

12. Remember the default logins:
    * Guest Account: (User Name: guest)  (Password:  guest)
    * Administrator Account:( User Name: Admin)  (Password:  admin)
    * For security, delete the latter as soon as you have a set up a new 
        account - with Super privileges! - that works.
